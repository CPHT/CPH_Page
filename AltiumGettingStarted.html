<h2><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>

<p>This documentation presents a beginners guide on how to use Altium and its operations. 
    After reading through this guide, you should have a basic understanding of the important 
    concepts that are used in building PCBs. Please note that this is to help a new user get 
    started understanding and reinforcing the most practical applications of Altium Designer.</p> 


<h2><a name="NewProject">New Project</a></h2>

<p>After getting Altium installed on your machine, you can go ahead and start your new project. 
    Open up the application to get started. </p> 
<ul>
<li>Select "File"</li>
<li>Choose "New"</li>
<li>Click "Project" </li>
</ul>

<p>You should be presented with a following screen:</p>

<img alt="Altium" src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/AltiumNewProject.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 1: Creating a new Altium project</i>
<p>The "default" option will always be selected as the starting point. When you do make your selection, 
    the new project will be added to your screen. New documents are assigned with the ".PrjPcb" extension. 
 Next you will need to add either an existing schematic or create a new one. For simplicity, start with
  creating a new schematic.</p>


<ul>
    <li>Right-click on the new .PcbPrj file that you recently created.</li>
    <li>Highlight "Add New to Project".</li>
    <li>Select "Schematic".</li>
</ul>
<p>On your "Projects" panel, you should see 
a new document get added to the project. The default name for your schematic document is "Sheet1.SchDoc" </p>
<img alt="Altium" src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/02AltiumSchematic.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 2: Creation of a new Schematic document</i>
<p>On the main screen, you should also see a grid representing how to plot your design.</p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/03Schematic.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 3: Blank Schematic page</i>

<p>You will also want to create a new Pcb document. 
The steps are just the same as mentioned above for creating a schematic except for one detail.
Instead of selecting "Schematic" pick the "PCB".
On the "Projects" panel should be a new document added with the pcb extension. The default name 
will be "PCB1.PcbDoc". </p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/04Pcbaddition.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 4: PCB and Schematic document addition</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Note: The "Source Documents" means that the documents added will be located in the directory. Make sure anything you add for your project is located in the "Source Documents" or a new folder will be made called "Free Documents" that are not directly linked to your project.</b>

<p>The new Pcb document you added should also be displayed on the main screen. What should appear is a black rectangle. </p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/05Pcb.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 5: Pcb board screen</i>

<!--Panels -->
<h2><a name="Panels">Panels</a></h2>

<p>The "Panels" section is used for viewing different entries that coincide with 
your project. To locate the "Panels" menu,  look at the bottom-right corner of your Altium designer. </p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/06Panelbutton.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 6: location of the Panels button</i>

<p>When you click on the "Panels" button, it will display a list of options related to your project like so:</p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/07PanelSelection.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 7: Panel display. Note that areas with a check mark are panels you currently have open on your project.</i>
<p>Most of the time, besides constructing your boards on the 'Projects" panel, you will be editing setting in
     your "Properties" box depending on components you add. 
    When you click on a panel section to edit, the box will pop up in the middle of your screen.</p>


<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/08Propertiespanelfirstselect.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 8: Properties panel on first pop-up.</i>

<p>You can pin the screen you select over on either the left-hand or right-hand side of your screen by 
    clicking on the panel and dragging it to the desired location.</p>


<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/09Panelpinned.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 9: Properties panel snapped into the right-hand side of Altium.</i>

<p>If you click the thumbtack icon located in the middle of Figure 9, you can pin the the properties tab on the side when closing the screen. </p>


<!--INT-->

<h2><a name="Int">Integrated Libraries</a></h2>
<p>In addition to making new schematic and pcb files, we can also call for libraries that hold the schematics and footprints needed in our board designs. </p>
<b>Note: we have documentation on how to do this located <a href="https://github.com/CPHT/Altium/tree/master/AltiumDatabaseLibrary">here</a> </b>

<p>If you are wanting to install other integrated libraries</p>
<ul>
    <li>Click on "Panels".</li>
    <li>Select "Components".</li>
    <li>Click on the hamburger icon and choose "File-based Libraries Preferences..."</li>
</ul>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumextra/01Addlibrary.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 10: Adding libraries selection</i>
<p>From here you can install other integrated libraries depending on your project.</p>


<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumextra/02IntegratedLibraryPath.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 11: Adding libraries selection</i>

<!--Schematic Library -->
<h2><a name="Sch">Making a Schematic</a></h2>
<p>When you begin making a schematic, you can start with the general components that come with Altium Designer installed. If you have 
    another database you have access to, or other libraries stored on a local drive, you may use those as well.
    To begin creating a schematic, you can look at the toolbar that appears above the schematic page:</p>


<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/10SchematicToolbar.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 12: Schematic toolbar</i>

<h3>To start a schematic</h3> 
<ul>
    <li>Click on the "Panels" button</li>
    <li>Select the option "Components"</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get a new tab that will pin to the right-hand side of your screen called "Components".
     The dropdown menu will have two selections of integrated libraries: Miscellaneous Devices and
      Miscellaneous Connectors. 
    </p>


<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/11SchematicChoices.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 13: Prebuilt integrated libraries</i>
<p>When you click on one of .IntLib choices, you should see a list of already populated components. 
    For example, this is a screen you would see if you chose "Miscellaneous Devices". 
    </p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/12miscdevicesscreen.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 14: Default components selection regarding devices.</i>
<br><br>
<b>Note: If you are wanting to find more parts or looking for a specific component, you can choose 
    "Manufacturer Part Search".</b>
<p>Now you can select the component you are looking for and can drag the device over to your schematic. You can 
    also see what the device looks like in the preview and in 3D in the "Models" pane located in "Components"</p>
<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/13ModelShematic.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 15: Schematic placement and preview</i>
<br><br>
<b>Note: An important piece to remember is regarding net labels and port connections. 
    Net label connections only exist on the schematic sheet they are on, not in-between multiple schematic sheets.
Ports provide connections in between schematic sheets and no on the schematic sheet they are on.</b>

<h2><a name="CompileDesign">Compile Design</a></h2>
<p>When you finish designing your schematics you will want to compile. Ideally, everything will compile with 
    zero errors being issued. But with designing anything in preliminary stages, 
    you will often find errors and warnings when you first compile the design.</p>


<h3>To compile</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Right-click the project file</li>
    <li>Select "Compile PCB Project"</li>
</ul>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/14CompileProject.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 16 Compile project</i>
<p>Once you compile your project, you will then need to check your messages for warnings and errors. 
    If your message box doesn't appear, click on "Panels" and select "Messages".</p>


<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/15ErrorList.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 17: Error List</i>

<p>Depending on your messages, there can be some quick fixes</p>

<h3>For floating pin errors</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Right-click on the error/warning in the "Messages" panel containing the errors.</li>
    <li>Select "place specific no ERC error violation...".</li>
</ul>

<p>This will let you place a cross on the pin not being used and will clear the warning/error message.</p>

<h3>For no driving source errors</h3>
<p>This happens to pins that are not being put in use and have not been completely eliminated.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to "Place" on the top screen.</li>
    <li>Select "Directives".</li>
    <li>Choose "No ERC"</li>
</ul>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/16NoERC.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 18: No ERC selection</i>
<p>This will allow you to place an x over any pins that do not need to be used.</p>

<h2><a name="erules">Electrical Rules/Footprints</a></h2>
<p>You will need to check your basic electrical rules you want your project to follow. 
To find the electrical rules</p>
<ul>
    <li>Right-click "Project"</li>
    <li>Select "Project Options"</li>
</ul>
<p>Here you will find multiple tabs regarding various rules for your current project.</p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/17ElectricalRules.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 19: Project options list</i>
<p>Rules here can be modified to suit your project. If you want to switch back, 
just press the 'Set to Default Installations" below. The last thing you need to 
check are the footprints that can be found in the database. This is more precautionary 
than necessary since validation should succeed.</p>

<h3>To check footprints</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Go to "Tools"</li>
    <li>Select "Footprint Manager"</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be presented with a component list that is included in the design. To validate the list</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hold the shift key and select that final entry.</li>
    <li>On the "View and Edit Footprints" screen, select all the components.</li>
    <li>Press "Validate".</li>
</ul>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/18Validate.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 20: Validating footprints</i>
 <p>Once validated, we know the components have been found and can be used on the PCB.</p>

<h2><a name="PCBtrans">PCB Transfer</a></h2>

<p>After completing your schematic sheets, you can now transfer your  on to designing your PCB.</p>
<h3>To transfer your schematics to the PCB</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Select your schematics sheet.</li>
    <li>Choose "Design" from the top menu.</li>
    <li>Click "Update PCB".</li>
</ul>
<p>You will then be presented with the following screen called the "Engineering Change Order".</p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/19engineeringchangeorder.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 21: Engineering change order</i>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Click "Execute Changes" </li>
    <li>check for any errors by selecting the checkbox "Only Show Errors"</li>
</ul>
<p>If no errors exist, switch over to your PCB and you should find new "rooms" 
depending on your schematic sheets included.</p>

<h2><a name="PCBrules">PCB Rules</a></h2>
<p>PCB settings also have there own set of rules that must be adhered to when moving on to the PCB design. 
   Before you begin, its recommended to set your rules prior before building the circuit board as you see fit.
    Designing before modifying or correcting the rule set can lead down to further complications on your project.</p>
<h3>To View the PCB rules</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Select your PCB document</li>
    <li>Click "Design" at the top menu</li>
    <li>Choose "Rules...".</li>
</ul>

<p>This will open you up to a new screen called the 
    "PCB Rules and Constraints Editor". Here you can 
    enforce or disable rules as you see fit.</p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/20RulesandconstraintsPCB.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 22: Rules and Constraints window</i>
<br>
<b>Note: Have full acknowledgement of what rules you disable. 
Rules that are not in effect can cause massive fatal errors 
when designing your pcb board.</b>
<p>There are two types of rules that exist in PCB construction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unary</li>
<li>Binary</li>
</ul>
<p>Unary rule will only focus on one object. In contrast, a binary rule will focus on two objects. 
If you need to add a new rule that isn't covered by the default option, you can do the following.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Under "Design Rules" right-click the selection underneath (i.e Routing).</li>
    <li>Select "New Rule".</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Note: When you make a new rule, whatever option selected on the right-hand 
    side will appear to duplicate with a "_1" on the end and increment with each new rule established.</b>
<br>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/21Newruleduplicate.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 23: New rule creation</i>
<p>Rules come into action based on the queries made for the selected object. </p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/22selectedquieries.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 24: Object queries page</i>
<p>You can set the scope for the query selection and keeping the constraints mode in check. 
For example, if you had a high voltage net you want to use a net class option instead of
using "All - All" If you change the scope, you may also need to change the Priorities 
section as well. Click the "Priorities" button below to see the values.</p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/23EditPriorities.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 25: Edit rule priorities panel</i>
<p>In all cases, if you have a new scope, you want the scope to be above "All - All" and "All - All" 
    should be in the lowest priority. This is because Altium uses a method that whatever the high rule catches, 
    the lower rules will not see. For example, in "All - All" scenario, any special rules may not get applied.</p>


<h2><a name="PCBcomponent">PCB Component Placement</a></h2>
<p>At this point, you can start moving components onto your PCB board and get started making your creations. 
    On your PCB, you can start moving boards or rooms around where you desired.</p>
<b>Note: If you try to move a component outside of its room, you will start compiling errors.</b>
<p>When you select components to move, you have two types of object selections. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Right-to-Left</li>
    <li>Left-to-Right</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are creating a rectangle moving right-to-left, it will select every component it touches. 
    This is true if the wire connected to a component outside the rectangle is connected. As long as the
     wire is caught in the rectangle, that attached component will be highlighted. 
    Using the left-to-right option will only select everything that rectangle contains. What this means 
    is if you only highlight part of a component, it won't get picked up in the selection. 
    You can also see your designs in 3d by pressing "3" and can see your work in 3d by holding shift key. 
    To move back into 2d, press number "2".</p>


<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/24mode3d.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 26: 3D mode</i>


<h2><a name="PCBrouting">PCB Routing</a></h2>
<p>When routing your PCB board, you have options on which layers to use during routing. 
    On the bottom of your PCB board screen, you will see all the layers that are 
    associated with the PCB.</p>


<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumimages/25layerlocation.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 27: PCB layer association</i>
<br>
<h3>To route manually or Interactive Routing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Be on your PCB.</li>
    <li>Click "Design".</li>
    <li>Select "Interactive Routing" or do ctrl+w.</li>
</ul>

<h3>To route on multiple layers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Click on area to begin.</li>
    <li>Move to desired location and left-click to
            create a vertex or vertices.</li>
    <li>Press "+" to create a link in the next layer. </li>
</ul>
<p>At this point you will want to start doing a polygon pour.
     A polygon pour can help cover idle space on a board. The idle 
     space covered can help connecting to ground wires and improve power efficiency. </p>
<h3>For polygon pours</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Select "Place".</li>
    <li>Choose any of the polygon pour designs that works for you.</li>
    <li>Right-click to exit the polygon pour mode when you complete.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="DesignRuleCheck">Design Rule Check</a></h2>
<p>When nearing the end of your PCB layout you will want to run a design rule check to validate your layout.
     When running a check on your layout,
     you can generate a more detailed list of any errors that may still be in your board. To start:</p>
     <ul>
         <li>Click "Tools".</li>
         <li>Select "Design Rule Check".</li>
         <li>Choose "Run Design Rule Check".</li>
     </ul>
<p>This will generate a new report called a "Design Rule Verification Report". The report will show rule 
    violations 
    and a more in-depth report about the errors. You messages panel will also display the errors as well. </p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumextra/03AltiumErrors.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 28: Verification report</i>
<p>While still on your PCB screen, there will be a new selection in the panels called "PCB Rules and Violations".
     Opening the scree, you can see the errors and highlight what you need to fix. 
    Double clicking the error messages will take you to the screen and allow you to fix the mistake.</p>

<h2><a name="Fabrication">Fabrication</a></h2>
<p>The last step before moving into production is to generate the fabrication files.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to "File".</li>
    <li>Select "Fabrication Outputs".</li>
    <li>Click "Gerber files". </li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Note: Gerber files is considered the industry standard.
     Unless noted otherwise, you fabrication output will usually be using Gerber files.</b>
<p>You will get a screen called the gerber Setup that will go over the layers and 
    how you want your drilling to proceed.</p>

<img src="{{ "/assets/Altiumextra/04.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 29: Gerber setup screen</i>
<br>
<p><i>General</i>:   Determines how our units will be plotted and the how we want the output format to be filed.
</p>
<p><i>Layers</i>:   What layers you want to be plotted. The default will be absent.</p>

<p><i>Drill Drawing:</i>   How you want to set up your drill pairs.</p>
<p><i>Apertures:</i>   Used for uploading or creating aperture files.</p>
<p><i>Advanced:</i>:   More specific settings regarding other changes.</p>
<p>You will do the same to generate the drill files only this time you will select "NC drill files".
The other option you will select for the end is the pick and place files. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to "File".</li>
    <li>Highlight "Assembly Outputs".</li>
    <li>Choose "Generates pick and place files"</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these options will generate new files in the "Generated" folders for Altium Designer.</p>
<h2><a name="BoardReview">Board Review</a></h2>

<p>Before sending out your project for fabrication, you want to go through an extensive board review. This is to help catch any errors
        as well as make any improvements on the current design.</p>
