      <h2>Web Design</h2>
      <p>If you are wanting to focus on front-end development and making website changes, we have a path 
        concentrating on what you will need to learn. We advised starting with Jekyll and learning the basics 
        that come from the program. What you learn from here will take you into the concepts behind html. There you
        can move into making the website look dynamic with CSS/Sass and using Javascript.</p>

      <h2>Programming and AWS</h2>
      <p>Moving along and understanding how Javascript works, you can start applying such concepts into 
        programming. We use here Python, Swift, and C if you go down the engineering path. In addition, we also 
        encourage how to use AWS CodeCommit.</p>

        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>Other concepts and protocols you will need to learn while you are here as well. This includes how to
          operate a raspberry pi. You'll learn how to make the LED blink and how to SSH. You will also need to understand how Application Program Interface 
        (API) works.</p>
