  <h1>Rosetta Stone for CPH</h1>

  <b>Author's Note:</b>

  <p>Please be advised that in no way do I want anyone changing the way they take their notes. Whenever you are 
  creating your project, just as I do with the documentation, I have a custom way of documenting my findings 
  before a rought draft. No matter what, you'll have to go over your notes and demonstrations more than once. 
  Don't worry about your format of the project when presenting me with your notes 
  (I usually will have to build and test the end result anyway when adding a FAQ section). What I have presented
   in the documentation is just what would be the ideal end result. If more information is needed I've also 
   provided a documentation template for the final product <a href="https://github.com/CPHT/Rosetta-Stone/blob/master/RosettaStone/Files/DocumentationTemplate.md">here.</a></p>

  <p>The motto is simple: Leave me a trail, and I will make a path</p>

  <h2><a name="Preamble">Preamble</a></h2>

<p>With software development favoring open to the public, we have a variety of audiences to cater for. Now many of
  <br>us in computer science can understand the concepts and how software operates after the initial build. However,
  <br>we must also be inclusive about others who may only have generic technical expertise.</p>

<p>Our documentation will serve two purposes: we want our work to be easy to understand for users of all levels in
  <br>technology, but also encourage others to step into the field.</p>

<h2><a name="Intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Any project you create should always have an introduction. The introduction doesn't have<br>
  to be anything long or verbose. As long as you can succiently convey the information for the<br>
  user to understand, that should solve it.</p>

<h2><a name="TableofContents">Table of Contents</a></h2>

<p>Having a table of contents provides multiple benefits when completed. A user can see just<br>
  what everything is included in the readme. The user can click on the sections (like the toc I provided above)<br>
  and can then click back to the previous screen. I included this mainly due to not <br>
  wanting to scroll through everytime I needed the right information. Usually the skeleton will look like this:</p>

[Go here](#gohere)

<p>And this will include a < div> tag to link the section.</p>

<h2><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>

<p>As stated above, include a summary of what your project can do. A summary <br>
  may also have to be added to sections in case users have questions. The summary <br>
  can also be included in the introduction if you don't think a closing doesn't needed to be provided.</p>

<h2><a name="Sections">Sections</a></h2>

<p>One argument many generic users experience is that not having sections<br>
  properly dedicated to certain steps or when switching off to a different <br>
  program. This is usally in part that we think a user may know what to do intuitively.</p>

<p>When we break up parts into sections, we can be safe to assume the user<br>
  won't get lost or have to backtrack. This helps create a README that a user<br>
  can use just like they are reading a book.</p>

<h2><a name="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></h2>


<p>The prerequisites should always be included before beginning the project <br>
  gets underway. Theres no point continuing if the right ingredients aren't included.<br>
  When adding this section, this should be the second section right after the introduction/summary.</p>

<p>In the prerequisites, also make sure you include what operating system is <br>
  being used for testing (Windows/Mac/Linux) before continuing down the road.</p>

<h2><a name="Steps">Steps</a></h2>

<p>When including steps for following a procedure, keep only one step at a time.<br>
  Sometimes steps get conglomorated into one step that can throw a user off. For example:</p>
<ul>
  <li class="text">Upgrade the software to 3.7.6, Accept all defaults, and then continue.</li>
</ul>

<p>Though many of us can follow that, its best practice to keep the steps as one at a time.<br>
  This can also be called one-sentence-at-a-time. Plus depending on the hardware/sorftare, <br>
  the user may experience something else as "default"</p>


<h2><a name="UsingBulletPoints">Using Bullet Points</a></h2>

<p>Bullet points I would only would like to use one source.</p>

<ul>
  <li>step one</li>
  <li>step two</li>
  <li>step three</li>
</ul>

<p>When we start adding more bullet points underneath, it starts adding pressure<br>
  to keep moving around on the document instead of giving them a clear starting point.<br>
  We want the user to either move on to the next bullet point or to continue reading <br>
  the same bullet point followed by a period.</p>

<p>The bullet points aren't necessarily the main point but keeps the format in line.<br>
  The user's eyes know where to start on the page by the second bullet point. From there<br>
  a user will be able to pick up where they left off and can continue with their instructions.</p>

<h2><a name="Figures">Figures</a></h2>

<p>Adding diagrams for users will help deomnstrate a point. This also correleates to if<br>
  the user gets lost, all they have to do is make sure the correct figure appears on screen.</p>

<h4>When adding a figure</h4>
<ul>
  <li>add italics underneath naming the figure with a one line description as example</li>
</ul>
<img alt="Google banner" src="{{ "/assets/DocumentationFiles/figureexample.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 1: Google's Fourth of July Banner</i>
<ul>
  <li>(Optional) Add an 'title' tag that can appear when a user hovers over the image.<br>
    This might go into a longer explanation for the image or where to look at in question.</li>
</ul>

<img title="Google's banner during 4th of July in 2019."
  src="{{ "/assets/DocumentationFiles/figureexample.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<br>
<i>Figure 2: Google's Foruth of July Banner updated</i>
<br><br>
<b>Note: Adding to the visual representation, a figure placement can also <br>
  breakup the eye drain users experience looking thorough the documentation.</b>

<h2><a name="Notes">Notes</a></h2>

<p>When adding notes, always keep it in bold but spell note like 'Note' not 'NOTE'.<br>
  I have found that users will go to that note first before anything else. Add the notes as such:</p>

<b>Note: Read the documentation before asking any questions</b>

<p>In this case, the note isn't pulling the reader away from the documentation but<br>
  reminds them this is important to read before continuing.</p>

<h2><a name="CodeBlocks">Code Blocks</a></h2>


<p>When you include a use for code blocks, I would like code blocks to be used only<br>
  for code blocksand not to be used consecutively with folders or filepaths.</p>

```
if this == true:
print ("You are correct")
```

<p>When you make a code block, wrap the entire piece with three (3) ``` <br>
  symbols on top and bottom of the text.</p>

<h2><a name="FAQ">FAQ</a></h2>

<p>Frequently asked questions should be included at the end and be linked <br>
  into sections we assume users might have difficulty understanding. It doesn't<br>
  matter how good your software/project is, there will always be curious users.</p>

<b>This didn't work, what should I do?</b>
<ul>
  <li>Try something different</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="IssueHistory">Issue History</a></h2>

<p>As issues and bugfixes arrive with your software, you will want to add<br>
  what has changed with each different version that comes out. Formatting for<br>
  this section may look like this:</p>

<b>July 3, 2019</b>

<p>Discovered a new error in the testing software. It kept kicking out<br>
  the user instead of logging them in. Made the following corrections.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Corrected the said bug.</li>
  <li>Developed a new interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Endnote">Endnote</a></h2>

<p>Most of the time, I will be running through the projects you create so that<br>
  I can add on and build the project. There will always be more to add even with<br>
  a perfect documnetation you bring to me. Even this readme I'm creating has gone through 5-6 revisions.</p>

<p>I understand that documentation is boring to many and that others should innately<br>
  get how to use software (there is a reason why I'm here). I mainly put my case here <br>
  for when you are developing software somewhere else you can take the lessons you learned<br>
  here to showcase your software. The goal is to get anyone to use your project, regardless of technical skill.</p>
