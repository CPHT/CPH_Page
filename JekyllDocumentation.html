## Introduction
---
Jekyll is a simple static site generator that can be set as a landing page or an intro for those getting used to web development. You can work with Jekyll environments using a markup language such as HTML and Markdown. Your website can be hosted on Github, avoiding the costs for storing your website on a server. As you learn Jekyll, you will be able to customize your site with original layouts or those located in the Jekyll themes.

<div id='pre'>

## Prerequisites
---
**Note: This is for Windows installation only. Ruby and Ruby Gems already comes pre-installed on Macs and can be checked using the terminal command:** `ruby -v` 


#### Ruby

- Go to the [Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) website.
- Choose the "Ruby Devkit 2.5.5-1 (x64)" for Windows 10. You should look for the following link:

<img alt="Jekyll installation" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/RubyInstallWindows.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<img src="images\RubyInstallWindows.PNG">


- Click on the .exe icon to begin installation.
- Accept the License agreement that appears.
- On the next page, go ahead and click "Install".
- With "Select Components", accept the default and click "Next".
- After installation, you will be presented with this screen:

<img src="images\rdiskinstall.PNG">

- Make sure to check the checkbox that appears.

#### Ruby Command Prompt

Although the first part of Ruby is complete, there are extra steps to follow once initial installation is complete. A command prompt screen will for running Ruby with various options:

<img src="images\rubycmdinstall.PNG">


- For the safest installation, it's best to go through options 1, 2, and then 3.

- Close out of the application once option 3 is finished.

#### Command Line Check

Next we want you to check for any updates and to see if ruby installed correctly. You can use the Windows cmd or Git bash.

- Type the following command: `ruby -v` to check for the version of Ruby installed.

- Type the following command: `gem -v` to check for the Gem package installation. You should see something like the following after the two commands: 

<img src="images\rubygemcheck.PNG" >



- Run the following command: `gem install jekyll bundler`. This will install the jekyll package.
- You should get a confirmation after the command:

<img src="images\jekyllinstallsuccess.PNG">


- Check the version of jekyll before beginning by running the command: `jekyll v`. This should pop up the version installed:

<img src="images\jekyll_-v.PNG">

<div id='sitecre'>

## Site Creation
---
For creating a new default site:

- Open Terminal/Command Prompt/GitBash.
- Use command `cd` to where you would like the website files to appear.
- Type the following command: `jekyll new site` where "site" can be whatever you call your new website.

- The command will run though installing all your new default files:

<img src="images\jekyllnewsite.PNG">

A new folder directory will be created in your selected directory. The folder will include the default options such as `config.yml` and `index.md`. A snapshot of what you should see in your new folder should appear as such: 

<img src="images\jekyllcontentsfolder.PNG">

<div id='sr'>

## Site Running
---
Before getting a site up and running, 
- Use command `cd` to navigate to where you want to store your website's folder


Before setting up the website, you want to run this command for the first time:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

This command will generate the site and show the location of where it will it be located. You should have a terminal screen look like the following: 

<img src="images\jekyllexecserve.PNG">



**Note: you do not have to type `bundle exec jekyll serve` each time you bring the website online. After the first time, you can simply type `jekyll serve` or `jekyll s` in the directory.**

- Locate the "Server Address" section of the terminal to see where the website is hosting.
- Depending on what port the website is located, you will have to type in the address.
- type in the address bar "localhost:portnumber" where port number is the location of the address.
- The example below is using port 4000. What you should see is the default below for your website.

<img src="images\jekyllsiteonline.PNG">


**Note: The figure above is the default option for jekyll when you first create a website. Depending on theme and outlook you desire, results will look more modern.**


<div id="fc">

## Folder contents
---

When you first go in to customize your website, you will be confronted with a couple of folders that assist with configuration.

Opening your folder with any development studio, you should see the following show up:

<img src="images\jekfirstfiles.PNG">

Below is a brief explanation of the files and folders include:

- `_posts`: This is where your posts will be stored at, usually written in markdown format, if you decide to have a blog website.
- `_sites`: Holds what your final website layout will look like in html.
- `_sass-cache`: Holds the css capabilities
- `config.yml`: Acts as a master settings for overall variables for your website for storing configuration variables.
- `Gemfile`: Ruby file that stores the dependencies for our website. This is also where you would store the theme

More folders will be added as you go through the tutorial, but for now just keep these before moving on



<div id='themes'>

## Themes
---

**Note: It is highly recommended that you choose a theme before starting on your project. Chances are some of your layouts may not exist on the new theme you choose. This will result in your page looking outdated and errors popping up**

Jekyll by itself come be brought to life with some already generated themes. When you download the default settings, the first theme you should get is the `minima` setting. Check your `config.yml` to confirm.

If you are looking to wanting to use different themes, you can go to [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) of [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) for other pre-determined themes. Most of the themes will start with something similar to `jekyll-theme-xxxx`. 

#### To Install a theme

There are two ways tou can install a jekyll theme.

- Grab the theme name from the repository.
- Go to your source code editor of your choice and open the file "Gemfile".


- Add the theme plugin of your choice to your website like the following picture:

<img src="images\gemhanuman.PNG">

You can also install you theme by running the command:

`gem install theme-name`


**Note: At this point, you will have to shutdown and restart the server due to the overlapping change.**

#### After configuring the gem file

- Return to the `config.yml` file.
- Change the theme to the current structure of your theme of choice. 

**Note: You may also have to alter the layouts you have. Errors will occur if the layout included in the themes do not match.** 

<div id = 'cfm'>

## Changing Front Matter
---
What you put in the front matter is what used to display or talk to your  static site. You can think of the front matter of a site or webpage as the uniform for what the page will display. Front matter will always be displayed with `---` on the top and bottom section of the variables. 

#### To begin

- Open your jekyll site folder in the source code editor of your choice. In the examples provided, Visual Studio Code is used. 

When editing a page, you should see something on a default page look like the following: 

<img src="images\jekyllfrontmatter.PNG">



The figure above holds four variables for the front matter. 
- `layout`: What page matter wil be
- `title`: What that tab title will be called
- `date`: Specific for posts, but what the date displayed is an its creation time.
- `categories`: where the static file is stored at and the path.

The front matter written for Jekyll is written in [YAML](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) and [JSON](https://www.json.org/) syntax. If you are not familiar with either languages, the links provided will lead you to documentation on their correct usage. 

Any page you create will have to include some type of front matter. The `minima` theme that is the default has two different layouts: `page` and `post` where as others may only have a `default` option. Depending on either a chosen theme or custom theme you will have to see how the layout will look.

Most front matter will have at least the following
- layout:
- title: 
- permalink:

<div id='post'>

## Posts
---
**Note: This section is only used if you keep your website as a blog. Skip this section if your website will be different.**

Anytime you are wanting to create a blog-post, you will want to store it in the `_posts` category. Creating blog posts have certain rules that you must follow

#### To create a blog post
- Insert a new file into `_posts`
- When creating the file, the name must begin with the date. The date will always follow the format YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post
- Give the extension name to be either `md` for markdown or `html` for an html document. 

You can also define the layout, but using the `post` layout will look the best for a blog post.

**Note: If you are putting in a title for the post, make sure it has quotes "" wrapped around it. Otherwise you get the mapping value error:**

<img src="images\jekyllerrortitle.PNG">

#### For drafts

- Create a new folder called `_drafts`
- Make a new draft for the blog post, but do not give it a date. 
- When you are ready to make the post, update it accordingly with the title. An example of how to format the draft and folder is below

<img src="images\jekylldrafttest.PNG">


<div id='page'>

## Pages
---
When designing your pages, you will either design them in markdown or in html. Pages tend to have more room for style with presenting information.

#### When designing a page

- Choose the style you want your page to appear in either markdown or html.
- Set the front matter of your page to either `"page"` or in other cases with custom themes, `"default"`

For example, you can edit the `about` page you created to include a short bio about yourself.

#### Example: To Edit the About.md

- Click on the `about.md` file on your page
- If you want, keep the extension or change it to html. 

You should be presented with a pre-made document resembling the following:

<img src="images\jekyllabout.PNG">

- Clear all all the information except for the front matter.

- Write out a short bio for yourself like I have done below

<img src="images\jekyllnewabout.PNG">

- Save your results and go back to your website. Confirm your saved changes and they should appear:

<img src="images\aboutupdated.PNG">

As learning increases, you will want to add more pages to your site. In the example a tag is added in the last description. Let's say you want to create something like that.

#### Example: Building a new page

- Make a new file in your source code editor. You can place this anywhere, but for now, just keep it as an outside file like `about.md`.
- Choose the extension you would like to give the file.
- Name your file. What title you give it will appear on the new tab unless you make a title on the front matter.

**Note: give your new page a `permalink` variable like how the `about` has with any path you desire.**

- Fill in the information accordingly like in the example below: 

<img src="images\jekyllphilo.PNG">

 The example also includes a link to the `about` page linking to the `/philo/` page permalink.

<img src="images\jekyllphilolink.PNG">

When refreshing the page, both of the pages should update and one can navigate from `about` straight to the `philo` page:

<img src="images\jekyllpagelink.PNG">

Which in turn leads  to this page:

<img src="images\jekyllnewphilo.PNG">

<div id='configyml'>

## Changing _config.yml File
---
When you are editing the config file, it will have overall changes effective to any objects you use in the front matter (title, author, description, etc...). Editing the config file should be used when you do not want to type out the specifications every single time depending on what page you have displayed. 

For example look at the code snippet below in the config.yml file:

<img src="images\jekyllconfigdefault.PNG">

When you open any of your pages, you will notice how some of these variables show up on every page. 

- `title`: This could be the home navigation title.
- `email`: Your current email address.
- `description`: May be a short summary of your website.
- `markdown`: Current version of markdown .
- `theme`: Your website's theme.
- `plugins`: Any new plugins you added to Jekyll.

You can essentially develop anything you would want to use as front matter here of the `config` file. This can be applied to every page linked on a path. The example below will provide more clarity.

#### Example: Adding author to every post

Let's say you want to add an author to every one of the posts. Instead of writing the author every time, you can just use the `config.yml` file for that.

- Open your `config.yml` file
- scroll below and add in this default code block

<img src="images\jekdefaultsconfig.PNG">

A couple of these variables can be explained:

- `defaults -` custom defaults variable that can change our front matter overall
- `scope`: Searches for the path
- `path`: Folders of the files affected. If left blank or "" then the path will be applied to all files on the website. 
- `type`: This affects which pages will have the changes. In this example, we are affecting the "post" format
- `values`: Which values will be attributed to the configured variables. This could be used for `layout`, `title`, and `lang` attributes. 
- `author`: The variable we will use for every post to put our name.

The code block says for defaults, search the path of all files. If the file type is "post", we will add the author value "Hans." When refreshing and navigating to a post, we should see the author.

<img src="images\jekyllauthorvar.PNG">

We could also add the `layout` variable in the `defaults` section so we do not have to add that to the front matter for every `post`.

<img src="images\jekylllayoutvar.PNG">

This will now translate that any file saved in "posts" will have the "post" layout with the author "Hans"


<div id='layout'>

##  Layouts
---
Creating new layouts will involve a bit of adding new content through the following steps.

- On your text editor, create a new folder called `_layouts`.
- In the new `_layouts` folder, you can create new pages for customizing the layout by making html layouts. Typically, you will have something like a navigation bar or a title depending on your layout format.

**Note: Any page made in the _layouts folder should be marked as .html** 

You may have noticed that the formatting for your posts/pages look different. This is because the layouts that you add can override the default layouts with your own custom layouts.


#### When adding different layouts for  pages

- Create a new html document inside the `_layouts` folder. In this case, we will call it `wrapper.html` since it will wrap around the page header and footer.

- The `wrapper` will need to have a basic html skeleton laid out before starting that. Copy and paste the code block below to help get started or type "doc" to fill out the page.

```
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Wrapper</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

Inside the `wrapper` you can add what you could like for the content. But for now lets do something simple. Let's add a navigation bar for the `home`, `about`, and `philio` and a short quote at the bottom.

- Inside the `body` html section, add the following code block:

```
<body>
        <a href="http://localhost:4000" >Home</a><br>
        <a href="http://localhost:4000/About/">About</a><br>
        <a href="http://localhost:4000/philo/">Philosophy</a><br>
        
            {{ content }}
        
        <br> <i>Never stop learning</i>
</body>

```
The `{{ content }}` variable placement will call the content that shares the layout variable. In this case it will call any content sharing the `wrapper` variable.  

- Create a new file on the base settings called `wrapper.md`.
- Create the following front matter for the file.

```
---
layout: wrapper
title: Wrapper
permalink: /wrapper/
---
```
- Fill the markdown file with anything content-wise.
- Save your changes and refresh the website.
- Click on your "Wrapper" link on your website. You should see the following: 

<img src="images\jekyllwrapper.PNG">

Notice how dated the page looks. That's in part that you will need to create your own custom html layout if you would like to display the page differently. 

<div id='var'>

## Adding Variables
---
The variables you add to your static website through your jekyll template act as way-points to converse on the page. At this point of the tutorial, you have already worked with a number of variables These include the following global variables:

- `layout`
- `site`
- `content`


We can also make our own variable and add it depending on the use of other variables. For example, say you want to add an author to a page to our `wrapper` content. 

###  To add a new variable

- Open your `wrapper.html` file.
- Add front matter to include an `author` variable.
- Locate a spot you would like to include the author variable. To inherit the variable, you will use the code block.

```
   {{ layout.author}}
```
This means on the page, Jekyll will call the `author` variable that is attached to the `layout` template. In this example, the author is "Hans."

<img src="images\jeklayout.author.PNG">

When you reload the page and go to the "wrapper" page, you should see the author listed.

<img src="images\jekauthorsite.PNG">



Variables can also be accessed from site pages as well. This will usually grab the variables from the `config.yml` file and can be used as a default accessor. 

Let's say you want to add the title and author from the `config` file and apply it to your pages. Use this in the `wrapper` file as an example.

- Go to your `wrapper.html` file.
- Pick a placement and add the following code block.
```
{{ site.title }}
```
If you haven't changed your title yet, the text that should pop up is "Your awesome title".

Refresh the website after include the code block and see if the title is visible.

<img src="images\jeksitevariable.PNG">

Using the `site` variable will always pull what the variable is for the second object form the `config` file. The `config` and `wrapper` page, when finsihed, should look like the following:


If you are wondering about any other variables that are used, you chan checkout the [Jekyll variables](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/)

<div id='includes'>

## Includes 
---
When you have the `_includes` folder attached to your website, you can think of it as a root directory for different aspects of your code. Maybe you want certain code do be putt for your header. The footer may be different depending on the page you land. 

The `_includes` can serves as the way-point for various small code applied to different html pages. We can set up our folder as the following.

#### To Start

- Make a new folder called `_includes` for where we will place the html code.
- Place a new html file that we will use. 

In this example, we will put our email address as our header when you view the `wrapper` file. 

- Inside your file, create th code block to put your email in the header. A simple example of the code block can be:
```
<h4>{{ site.email }}</h4>
```

- Back to your `wrapper.html` file, add your code block \:

```
{% include blank.html%}
```
"blank" can be anything. In the example, the "blank" file is named "emailheader"

<img src="images\jekemailheader.PNG">

Now when your reload the page, it should look something like this:

<img src="images\jekemailheadersite.PNG">

`_Includes` can also possess different information for stylish effects such as changing color

- Inside the following code loop you can make a new variable. Let's say color

- Modify your code block to look like the following:
`{ % include whatever.html color="blue" %}`

Back in your `_includes` you can have something like the following:
```
<h4 style="color:  {{include.color}}">{{ site.email}}</h4>
```

which if applied correctly a different color should appear:

<img src="images\jekemailcolor.PNG">

**Note: You may have an error come up that happens when you include ``{{ include.color}}``. The system is expecting a css case but will still function correctly.
 

<div id='Loop'>

## Designing Loop Conditionals
---
Using loops is a great way to build a navigation list or being able to list a way through going information that someone may be seeking that is not on the home page.

### When designing a navigation list
- use the following code block
```
{% for variable in site.variables %}
    content to loop through
{% endfor %}
```
What this means is for every loop represents variable included in every variable specified we would like to take an action.

So for printing out all our post titles we could use the code block
```
{% for post in site.posts%}
        <li>{{post.title}}</li>
    {% endfor %}
```

Which as nice as this is, we do not have links to the posts

#### Building a separate list

- To keep damage to a minimum, make a new file in your `_layouts` called `PostsListings.html`
- Inside the new file, put in the following code block:

```
{% for post in site.posts%}
        <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{post.title}}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
```
The code block states that we will create a list and print out the title. The title for each link will then reference the link in our post.

- Create a new markdown file called `postlistings.md`
- Give this file a layout `PostsListings`. You can also add other front matter but just make sure you are using the right layout. 

 <img src="images\jekpostlistings.PNG">

 - You may also add in other content to the markdown file before refreshing the website.
 - Click on your new tab called "Lists of Posts." you should have a new page that looks like the following with any posts you have created.

 <img src="images\jeklistofpsts.PNG">
 
<div id='conditionals'>

## Conditionals
---
 Using a conditional is just like the following:

`{% if something.variable == "something"%}`
`This is a test`
`{% endif %}`

You may also use "{% elseif %}"  of "{% else %}" which is just the same as an "else if" statement in other programming languages. you also end these with `{% endif %}`

The conditional statements can also add more style to a navigation list. for example, you can have a highlight on your current page.

<div id='datafiles'>

## Adding Data Files
---
The data files for you site can be seen like mini databases for basic information

The information either needs to be in the following languages: `yml`,`.json`, or `.csv`.

#### Storage

- create a new folder directory called `_data` 
- create a new page with either a `yml`, `json`, or `csv` tag

You will have to write the data according to whichever extension you use how to access the files.

`{{ site.data.whatever}}` 

You can also loop through with:

`{% for whatever in site.data.whatever %}`

Good if you are not wanting to use blog matter and just keep it as a table or such

<div id='static'>

## Static Files
---
Static files that don't have front matter can be stored and how they can be accessed as well as printed out

**Note: for static files, you do not have to store them in a folder. However, it is recommended for organization purposes**

#### Creation

- create a folder for images
 to loop through 
 -`{% for file in site.static_files &} {{ file.path}} {% endfor %}`

You can also do others:
- file.name
- file.basename
- file.extname

You can give the images front matter that may require moving to a new folder and configuring the `config.yml` file such as

`defaults:`
    <p style="margin-left: 15px">`- scope:`</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 45px">`path: whichever path images are located`</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 30px">`values:`</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 45px">`image: true`</p>


This can used such as<br>
`{% if file.image %}`<br>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px">`img src="{{file.path}}" alt="{file.name}"`</p>
`{% endif %}`

<div id='githubhosting'>

## Hosting
---
Github pages will host your jekyll site for free, with either their own github domain name or one you have paid for. 

What you should have before this step
- github account
- git bash

#### On github

- go to your github account
- click "New repository"
- give your repository a name
- don't initialize the README

#### Back on your IDE

- go to config.yml
- at the baseurl, either put the sub-path of your site, include the name or your repository
-if you use a custom domain name, put that instead

You want to make sure you name your baseurl and the url correctly. Your url will contain your user name as well as the github link if you are not using a customizable domain. The domain path will look like "https://username.github.io". For your baseurl, this is where you put the folder path to the name of the repository you created. A figure below describes the format:

<img src="/Jekyll-Documentation-master/images/JekyllUrlPath.png">

**Note: When you add your "/" to your directory in the baseurl and url categories, add them in just as you see in the diagram. Missing a slash here can make the page load in only basic html and may not be able to find the file path where the css or sass files are located.**


#### On Git

- Type `git init`
- Type `git checkout -b gh-pages`
- Type `git status`
- Type `git add .` This will commit all changes you have made
- Type `git commit -m "initial commit"`

#### On Github
- Grab the link for you repository setup. It should be under "...or create a new repository on the command line" and inside the `git remote` command
- Grab only the `https` portion that ends with `.git`

#### Back to git
- Type in the command `git remote add origin "github link you grabbed"`
- Type the command `git push origin gh-pages` 

#### On Github
- Go to settings.
- Scroll to under github pages.
- Open link where your site is located.

At that point your website is good for deployment.

#### To make changes on the gh-pages
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "message"`
- `git push origin gh-pages`

This will update any changes you make
