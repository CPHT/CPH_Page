<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Jekyll is a simple static site generator that can be set as a landing page or an 
    intro for those getting used to web development. You can work with Jekyll environments 
    using a markup language such as HTML and Markdown. Your website can be hosted on Github, 
    avoiding the costs for storing your website on a server. As you learn Jekyll, you will 
    be able to customize your site with original layouts or those located in the Jekyll 
    themes.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<b>Note: This is for Windows installation only. Ruby and Ruby Gems 
    already comes pre-installed on Macs and can be checked using the terminal command:</b>

    <h3>Ruby</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Go to the <a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">Ruby</a> website</li>
    <li>In the "With Devkit" section, choose the appoprpriate version.</li>
</ul>

<img alt="Windows download section" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/RubyInstallWindows.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<ul>
    <li>Click the .exe icon to begin installation.</li>
    <li>Accept the license agreement that appears.</li>
    <li>On the next page, go ahead and click "Install".</li>
    <li>With "Select Components", accept the default settings.</li>
    <li>Click "Next".</li>
    <li>After installation, you will be presented with this screen: </li>
</ul>
<img alt="Ruby Setup" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/rdiskinstall.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<ul>
    <li>Make sure to check the checkbox that appears in the following figure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ruby Command Prompt</h3>
<p>Although the first installation of Ruby is complete, there are a few extra steps to follow once initial installation is 
    complete. A command prompt screen will appear when running Ruby with the various options:

<img alt="Ruby Setup" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/rubycmdinstall.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<ul>
    <li>For best installation purposes, its best to go through options 1, 2, and then 3.</li>
    <li>Once option 3 is complete, close out of the application.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Command Line Check</h3>
<p>Next you want to check for any updates as well as if Ruby is installed correctly. For this 
    section, you can either use the Windows command line propt or Git bash. The example provided
    is using git bash.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>To check the version of Ruby installed, type the following command: ruby -v</li>
    <li>For the Gem package installation, type the following command: gem -v.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you type in the previous two commands, you should see versions for both packages. Make
    sure you see a screen like the following below:
</p>
<img alt="Ruby and Gem Versions" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/rubygemcheck.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<p>The next step will involve installing the Jekyll bundler package. The reason you want to install
    Jekyll with bundler is it helps track dependencies on projects.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Type the following command into your prompt: gem install jekyll bundler</li>
    <li>You should get a confirmation after the command:</li>
</ul>
<img alt="Installation successful" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/jekyllinstallsuccess.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
<ul>
    <li>Check the version of jekyll by typing the following: jekyll -v</li>
</ul>
<img alt="Jekyll version" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/rdiskinstall.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

<h1>Site Creation</h1>

<p>Once you have everything in the previous sections installed and working correctly,
    you can now go ahead and create your default site. When you have jekyll running, you'll
    be able to see how your website appears before hosting the website on an actual server.
</p>
<p>For creating a new site:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open either your Terminal/Command Prompt/GitBash</li>
    <li>Type the following command "cd" to navigate where you would like to store
        your website files. 
    </li>
    <li>Once you have your location determined, type the following command: "Jekyll new site". The 
        "site" can be named to whatever you prefer.
    </li>
    <li>The command will execute and install all your default files, you should see something resembling the following
        figure below:
    </li>
</ul>
<img alt="Jekyll new site creation" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/jekyllnewsite.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

<p>After running through the previous steps above, a folder will appear where you selected your site to be. You can also
    view the file path of where the folder appears at the bottom of your terminal. The default options include files such
    as config.yml and index.md. A sample snapshot for what you should see is provided. 
</p>

<img alt="Jekyll version" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/jekyllcontentsfolder.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

<h1>Site Running</h1>

<p>You should now be ready to make a test run of what your website looks like. 
    Jekyll provides a default css skin and layout that will generate if you decline
    changing any features.</p>

<p>To get the site running:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use the command "cd" to navigate to your website's directory</li>
    <li>Once inside, go ahead and run this command if its the first time you run the website: "bundle exec
        jekyll serve". 
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The reason behind running the command "bundle exec jekyll serve" serves a couple of purposes. The command 
    "bundle exec" tells the computer to locate the Gemfile in your current directory. If installed correctly,
    there should already be one. Then "jekyll serve" will serve you site on the local </p>

<img alt="Jekyll version" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/jekyllexecserve.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

<p><b>Note: You do not have to type "bundle exec jekyll serve" each time you bring the website
    online. After the first time deployment, you can simply type "jekyll serve" or jekyll s" while
    you are in your project's directory.</b></p>

    <p>Once you have the previous screen appear on your desktop, you'll need to search the following
        for where to see your website in development.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Locate the "Server Address" section of the terminal. The address shown
            will display where the website is hosted. </li>
        <li>Type in the server address on your web browser "localhost:[portnumber]". In the example above, the port number is
            4000.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have kept all the default settings up to this point, you should a default template of the site. At the time of this 
            tutorial, the following website appears below.</p>

     <img alt="Jekyll site online" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/jekyllsiteonline.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" height="800" width="1100" />
    
    <p><b>Note: The figure above is the default jekyll theme "minima" that comes when first creating a Jekyll website. Your results will
        vary when adding custom themes and your own css styling.
    </b></p>

    <h1>Folder Contents</h1>

    <p>When you begin to personalize your website, you will be confronted with several folders and files that
        are part of the configuration. You may open your project with the development studio of your choice. In this example, I am
        using visual studio code. What will appear will be the screen below:
    </p>
    <img alt="Jekyll configuration files" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/jekfirstfiles.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
    <p>Below is a brief explanation of what the files and folders include:<p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>_posts</b>: This is where your posts will be stored at. They can be written in markdown format if you choose. 
            This directory will be beneficial if you decide on having a blog site.</li>
            <li><b>_sites</b>: This directory holds what your final website layout will appear in html.</li>
            <li><b>_sass-cache</b>: This holds the css configurations.</li>
            <li><b>config.yml</b>: This .yml file acts as a master setting for all variables included in your website.</li>
            <li><b>Gemfile</b>: Ruby file that stores the dependencies for the website. This is where you would also
            store the theme of your website if you choose a pre-made template.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course more folders can be added to your website if you so choose. As you continue the tutorial, you will add more directories for different content.</p>

        <h1>Themes</h1>
        <p><b>Note: It is highly recommended that you choose a theme before starting on your project. The reason behind this is some of the layouts you may want to use
            may not exist in a theme that you decide on. This could result in your page not complying with the CSS and cause loading errors.</b></p>
        <p>Jekyll can have pre-rendered themes that you may want to add to your site.  When you download the default 
            settings, the first theme you should receive is the <b>minima</b> theme. To confirm this, you can check your "config.yml" file for your
            current theme.
        </p>
        <p>If by chance you are wanting to use different thems you can go to <a href="https://rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a> or <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">Jekyll Themes</a> for other 
        pre-determined themes. Most of the themes will start with something similar to <b>jekyll-theme-xxxx</b>.</p>

        <h3>To Install a Theme</h3>
        <p>There are two ways you can install a jekyll theme</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grab the theme name from the repository you searched for from RubyGems or Jekyll.</li>
            <li>Go to your preferred source code editor.</li>
            <li>Open the file "Gemfile".</li>
            <li>Add the theme plugin of your choice to your website. It should look like the following:</li>
        </ul>
        
        <img alt="Jekyll new gem" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/gemhanuman.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
        <p>Another way you can install a theme name is typing in the command of your repository:</p>
        <p>"gem install theme-name"</p>
        <p><b>Note: At this point, you will have to shutdown and restart the server for your website due to changing the configuration. </b></p>
        <h3>After configuring the gem file</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Return to the "config.yml" file</li>
            <li>change the theme name to the one of your choice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Note; You may also have to alter the layouts you have. Errors will occur is you do not have matching layouts.</b></p>

        <h1>Changing Front Matter</h1>

        <p>What you select for the front matter will be used to display and talk to your website. The front matter acts as like a summary of
            what the particular page will display. Front matter will always be enclosed with a "---" on th top and bottom section of 
         the variables.
        </p>

        <h3>To view the front matter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Open your Jekyll site folder in the source editor of your choice. In the example provided, Visual 
                Studio Code is being used.
            </li>
        </ul>
            <p>When editing a page, you should see somehting on any webpage that includes the following:</p>

            <img alt="Jekyll front matter" src="{{ "/assets/JekyllImages/jekyllfrontmatter.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />
            <p>The figure above holds four common variables for the front matter.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>layout</b>: What the page matter or skeleton will be</li>
                <li><b>title</b>: This is what will be displayed on the tab</li>
                <li><b>date</b>: Specifically for posts, but what is the date displayed at the time of creation.</li>
                <li><b>categories</b>: Where the static file is stored at and the file path</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The front matter is written in <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html">YAML</a> and <a href="https://www.json.org">JSON</a> syntax. If you are 
            not familiar with either language, the links provided will lead you to documentation on how to get started.</p>
            <p>Any page you create will have to include some type of front matter. For example, the <b>minima</b> theme holds two different layouts 
            when first implemented: <b>page</b> and <b>post</b>. Other themes or custom layouts may only have an option labeled <b>default</b>. Depending on either a chosen theme 
        or a custom theme you will have to test the layout. Each one will take some tweaking before implementing. However, in most cases front 
    matter will have at least the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>layout:</li>
        <li>title:</li>
        <li>permalink:</li>
    </ul>
