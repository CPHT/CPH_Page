<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Jekyll is a simple static site generator that can be set as a landing page or an 
    intro for those getting used to web development. You can work with Jekyll environments 
    using a markup language such as HTML and Markdown. Your website can be hosted on Github, 
    avoiding the costs for storing your website on a server. As you learn Jekyll, you will 
    be able to customize your site with original layouts or those located in the Jekyll 
    themes.</p>
